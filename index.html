                    Owls are nocturnal birds of prey known for their sharp vision, silent flight, and ability to rotate their heads up to 270 degrees. Belonging to the order Strigiformes, there are over 200 species of owls worldwide, ranging from small owlets to large species like the Great Horned Owl.
                    They have forward-facing eyes, giving them excellent depth perception, and their asymmetrical ears help locate prey in the dark. Owls primarily feed on small mammals, insects, and other birds, using their powerful talons and sharp beaks. They are also symbols of wisdom in many cultures.
                    Fun Fact: Their feathers are specially adapted for silent flight!

                <p class="birds-features">
                    The sparrow is a small, social bird found worldwide, belonging to the Passeridae family. These birds are typically brown and gray with short, stout beaks adapted for seed-eating, though they also eat insects. Sparrows are known for their chirping calls and are often seen in urban areas, farms, and gardens. The house sparrow (Passer domesticus) is one of the most common species. Sparrows build nests in crevices, trees, or man-made structures and are highly adaptable to various environments.
                    Despite their resilience, some sparrow populations are declining due to habitat loss and pollution.

                <p class="birds-features">
                    A woodpecker is a type of bird known for its ability to peck at wood using its strong, pointed beak. Found worldwide, they primarily inhabit forests and wooded areas. Woodpeckers peck to find insects for food, create nests in tree trunks, and communicate with other birds. Their specialized skull absorbs shock from constant pecking, and their long, sticky tongues help extract insects from deep crevices. These birds play an essential ecological role by controlling pests and creating nesting
                    cavities used by other wildlife. Common species include the Downy Woodpecker and Pileated Woodpecker.
